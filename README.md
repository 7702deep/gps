Mobile technology offers researchers a new set of tools for collecting information on how people spend their time, in addition to where they are and whom they are with during their daily activities. There has been limited research conducted on survey designs for mobile devices. Even less research has focused on the usability of self-administered surveys on mobile devices over extended data collection periods. We used the functionality of a smartphone to capture information on people's attitudes, surroundings, interactions, and behaviours to gain a richer appreciation for the different lifestyles and personalities that characterize a particular population.
